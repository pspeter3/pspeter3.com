title: "The Blog is Back"
---

After a year long haitus from blogging, I'm finally bringing back the blog. The
major reason was that I could not get Octopress to build on my local machine.
Man, ruby is basically impossible to install these days. The point is the blog
will now be running on pure Jekyll with github pages.

It feels good to be back.
