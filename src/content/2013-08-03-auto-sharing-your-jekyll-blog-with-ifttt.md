title: "Auto Sharing Your Jekyll Blog with IFTTT"
---

I just recently [switched my blog over to Jekyll](/blog/2013/07/12/the-blog-is-back/) and as a result needed to figure
out how to automatically share my blog posts to social networks. IFTTT provies a RSS channel which can create this. You
can generate an RSS feed using the standard Jekyll. You can find mine [here](https://github.com/pspeter3/pspeter3.github.io/blob/master/rss.xml)
and use it as an example. From there I just used the IFTTT feed channel to pump out updates to [Twitter](https://ifttt.com/myrecipes/personal/4930522)
and [App.net](https://ifttt.com/myrecipes/personal/4930537)
